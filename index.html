    <p style='text-align:center;background-color:rgb(190,211,245);font-size:25px;box-shadow: 5px 10px 15px;line-height:1.5;padding:5px;'>What exactly is identity? How does it shape you? Not an ID card. Despite being obvious in our vision, it is still hard to see someone’s identity or who they are. There are different types of identity, such as cultural, gender, and religious identity. We often make assumptions about how an individual’s identity is shaped, like how some people think that First Nations people are Indian, which is definitely not true. Something that connects to assumptions is stereotypes. Stereotypes are everywhere and could be positive or negative.<br><br>Identity is the building block of someone and how it structures character. It includes a person’s qualities that they do not have control over. It is fluid and dynamic, constantly changing and evolving over time as we grow and learn new things about ourselves and the world around us. One aspect of our own identity is the strange way that each person perceives the world, and especially how that person sees themselves, like self-image.
